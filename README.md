# Session 3 and 4 ‚Äî Inference and Causality

This repository contains the materials for **Session X** of *Course Y*.  
- Slides: see [`slides/`](./slides/) folder  
- Notebooks: see [`notebooks/`](./notebooks/) folder

## üìë Session Outline
---

## Overview
This week transitions from **discrete Bayesian reasoning** (cookies, dice, Monty Hall)  
to **continuous inference**, **Fisher Information**, and finally to **sampling-based inference** using **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)**.
Second unit, covers the general topic of **Correlation** vs **Causation**, **Pearson correlation coefficeint**, **granger causality** and **DAGs**

We ask:
> What happens when we can no longer count outcomes ‚Äî or integrate analytically?

---

## Learning Goals

- Move from **discrete** to **continuous** Bayesian reasoning  
- Understand **conjugate priors** and when they simplify updating  
- Quantify **information** in data through Fisher Information  
- Grasp the motivation behind **Monte Carlo** and **MCMC** methods  
- Build intuition for sampling as an approximation to integration
- Learn about **Pearson correlation coefficeint**, **granger causality** and **DAGs**

## Notebooks

| # | Notebook | Topic | Description |
|---|-----------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | `1_InferenceAndCausality_Week2_ContinuousBayes.ipynb` | **Continuous Bayes** | From discrete Bayes to continuous updates. Introduces density-based posteriors, expectations, and credible intervals. |
| 2 | `2_InferenceAndCausality_Week2_FisherInformation.ipynb` | **Fisher Information** | Explores how the curvature of the log-likelihood reflects the precision of our estimates. Includes a Think Bayes‚Äìstyle interactive notebook. |
| 3 | `3_InferenceAndCausality_Week2_Distributions.ipynb` | **Conjugate Priors** | Review and glossary of common likelihood‚Äìprior pairs (Beta‚ÄìBinomial, Gamma‚ÄìPoisson, Normal‚ÄìNormal). Includes a short ‚ÄúConjugate Match Game.‚Äù |
| 4 | `4_InferenceAndCausality_Week2_MCMC_analogy.ipynb` | **MCMC Analogy** | Introduces Markov Chain Monte Carlo through an intuitive analogy (random walker). Students visualize how MCMC ‚Äúsamples‚Äù from a posterior. Ends with a reflection question. |
| 5 | `4_InferenceAndCausality_Week2_CorrelationVsCausation.ipynb` | **Pearson and Granger** | Contains a few examples of Pearson correlation coefficient calculation and granger causality checks for timeseries.|

## Recommended Flow

1. **Notebook 1** ‚Äî run through the ‚ÄúGuess the Coin‚Äù example  
2. **Notebook 2** ‚Äî explore Fisher Information interactively  
3. **Notebook 3** ‚Äî identify conjugate pairs and connect to Bayesian updating  
4. **Notebook 4** ‚Äî play with the MCMC analogy and answer the reflection question
4. **Notebook 4** ‚Äî calculate a few coefficieints and fill out exercise cell.

## üöÄ Environment Setup

Before starting, please **fork this repository** and create a fresh Python virtual environment.  
All required libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you encounter errors during `pip install`, try removing the version pinning for the failing package(s) in `requirements.txt`.  
> On Apple M1/M2 systems you may also need to install additional system packages (the ‚ÄúM1 shizzle‚Äù).

---

### macOS / Linux (bash/zsh)

```bash
# Select Python version (if using pyenv)
pyenv local 3.11.3

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip and install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Windows (PowerShell)
```bash
# Select Python version (if using pyenv)
pyenv local 3.11.3

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Upgrade pip and install dependencies
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Windows (Git Bash)
```bash
